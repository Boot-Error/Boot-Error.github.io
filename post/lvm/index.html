          <p class="markdown">I use Arch Linux on every machine in my possession.</p>
<p class="markdown">Within a year of its use, I realized what Arch Linux F**kups really mean and why people cry about it.</p>
<p class="markdown">But I figured out a escape to a problem I always faced during a f**kup, It's the disk partitions and re-installation.</p>

<h2 id="the-trouble" class="markdown">The Trouble <a class="header-anchor markdown" href="#the-trouble">↩</a></h2>
<p class="markdown">Traditionally you would have a setup like this.</p>
<pre><code>n00b:

- /dev/sda1
	- / (OS installation)
		- /home/user (home folder)
</code></pre>
<p class="markdown">Your everyhing is in the root partition. Now if by some reason your <code>root</code> is screwed, you have to spend time backing up
your <code>home</code> partition. And if you are a data hoader, you be spending time in backing it up to wipe clean the partition for fresh install.</p>
<p class="markdown">I have been with this setup before using Arch Linux but Ubuntu didn't screw itself up that often.</p>
<pre><code>intermediate:

- /dev/sda1
	- / (OS installation)
- /dev/sda2
	- /home/use (home folder)
</code></pre>
<p class="markdown">Now here are utilizing disk partitioning for <code>home</code> and <code>root</code> partitions.</p>
<p class="markdown">Why? because organization. But most importantly, there is separation b/w them. There is no need to worry about first case anymore.
Just wipe <code>root</code> and install again, you'll be up with fresh install with all your files not even touched.</p>
<p class="markdown">This was me for a whole again. It worked flawlessly, took be 1-2 days to get back on track with packages and necessary software.</p>
<h2 id="getting-better-at-the-game" class="markdown">Getting better at the game <a class="header-anchor markdown" href="#getting-better-at-the-game">↩</a></h2>
<p class="markdown">The f**kups got better since then, some of them were</p>
<ul class="markdown">
<li class="markdown">A update got interrupted due to network failure, didn't verify the packages and it failed to install a critical library <code>i18n</code>, which was a dependency to many software including <code>pacman</code>.
I figured out since it was installtion problem, might well re-install it. But <code>pacman</code> depended on this. I somehow fixed it by manually installing this libary, had to do some symlinks.</li>
<li class="markdown">Some startup service didn't start and the system refused to give me a shell. which required me a re-install.</li>
</ul>
<p class="markdown">The quest to tweak my Arch Linux to perfection was always on. This led me to <code>lvm</code>, it all sounded fancy because of it capabilities like <code>Logical Paritions</code> and its dynamic abilities.</p>
<h2 id="adopting-lvm" class="markdown">Adopting LVM <a class="header-anchor markdown" href="#adopting-lvm">↩</a></h2>
<p class="markdown">I found out about LVM while browsing list of applications in ArchWiki. It was the moment it struck that this is the setup I have been in grave need. A solution to a minor inconvinience.</p>
<p class="markdown">One particular feature which I love about LVM is</p>
<p class="markdown">That's right, running out of space because you use too many docker images? Expand your <code>root</code> on the fly without worrying about making up space adjacent to it.
This also means I can have multiple distros saved in rather small partitons because it can resized whenever required.</p>
<p class="markdown">Learn more about it</p>

<li class="markdown"><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/LVM" class="markdown">LVM - ArchWiki</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-setup" class="markdown">My Setup <a class="header-anchor markdown" href="#my-setup">↩</a></h2>
<p class="markdown">My setup to LVM is really simple. The only reason to choose this setup to have flexibility on managing partition without a headache, which means it takes some effort to set them up.</p>
<h3 id="physical-volume-setup" class="markdown">Physical Volume Setup <a class="header-anchor markdown" href="#physical-volume-setup">↩</a></h3>
<p class="markdown">I have single 256GB SSD in my thinkpad x1c which I have split into 2 physical partitions <code>/dev/sda2</code> and <code>/dev/sda3</code>, <code>/dev/sda1</code> is the boot partition.</p>
<p class="markdown">These partitions are configured to be our physical partitions. One explicitly for <code>distros</code> and other for <code>datadir</code> which will be <code>home</code> partitions.</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo pvs
  PV         VG      Fmt  Attr PSize    PFree
  /dev/sda2  distros lvm2 a--  &lt;118.71g &lt;68.71g
  /dev/sda3  datadir lvm2 a--   119.26g  49.26g
</code></pre>
<p class="markdown">If you own a system with hybrid disk setup, one being SSD usually 128GB and HDD of 1TB, the physical volumes can be set to use <code>root</code> to be loaded from SSD and <code>home</code> from HDD. Or want to be a master of optimization crafts, use parts of <code>root</code> and <code>home</code> in your SSD to speed up boot time and load the rest like <code>Music</code> from HDD.</p>
<p class="markdown">Such an ambition would be a mess to implement, but LVM makes it painless.</p>
<h3 id="volume-groups-setup" class="markdown">Volume Groups Setup <a class="header-anchor markdown" href="#volume-groups-setup">↩</a></h3>
<p class="markdown">Volume groups are collection of physical volumes, you can collate multiple physical volumes into a single group.
I choose to mirror my physical volumes as volume groups</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo vgs
  VG      #PV #LV #SN Attr   VSize    VFree
  datadir   1   1   0 wz--n-  119.26g  49.26g
  distros   1   1   0 wz--n- &lt;118.71g &lt;68.71g
</code></pre>
<p class="markdown">Volume groups gives you an abstract over your physical volumes, the <em>logical volumes</em> created are categorized into these volumes.</p>
<h3 id="logical-volumes" class="markdown">Logical Volumes <a class="header-anchor markdown" href="#logical-volumes">↩</a></h3>
<p class="markdown">This is the abstraction I seek to implement. On my X1C, this is the setup</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo lvs
  LV                   VG      Attr       LSize
  booterror-home-crypt datadir -wi-ao---- 70.00g
  arch-main            distros -wi-ao---- 50.00g
</code></pre>
<p class="markdown"><code>arch-main</code> is my current Arch Linux installation and <code>booterror-home-crypt</code> is the root partition for user <code>booterror</code> which is a <code>LUKS</code> encrypted partition. And Yes keep your personal data encrypted, will save you from intrusion by physical access like a theft :laughing:</p>
<p class="markdown">Note that the size of the partitions, I can use rest of free space in volume groups to make new partitions for different distros and respective users.</p>
<h3 id="final-structure" class="markdown">Final structure <a class="header-anchor markdown" href="#final-structure">↩</a></h3>
<p class="markdown">Here is my final disk structure with all the necessary complexities added just so I can <em>resize on the fly</em></p>
<pre><code>$ lsblk
NAME                               MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE  MOUNTPOINT
sda                                  8:0    0 238.5G  0 disk
├─sda1                               8:1    0   511M  0 part  /boot
├─sda2                               8:2    0 118.7G  0 part
│ └─distros-arch--main             254:0    0    50G  0 lvm   /
└─sda3                               8:3    0 119.3G  0 part
  └─datadir-booterror--home--crypt 254:1    0    70G  0 lvm
	└─booterror-home               254:2    0    70G  0 crypt
</code></pre>
<h2 id="there's-more" class="markdown">There's more <a class="header-anchor markdown" href="#there's-more">↩</a></h2>
<p class="markdown">I figured out LVM can do <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/LVM#Snapshots" class="markdown">snapshotting</a>, essentially a time machine for your partitions. One useful setup would be to have a snapshot of your bare minimum arch linux installation as a snapshot, whenever there is a f**kup and its beyond fix, just revert to this snapshot. You can keep a list of all packages you need to install in a txt file and run pacman right away after reverting to this bare minimum state.</p>
<p class="markdown">A snapshot setup would be more rewarding than a abstract just so I can resize on the fly.</p>
<p class="markdown">I need to experiment this setup, until then...</p>
